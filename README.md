# DNS Server in Rust

This project is an implementation of a DNS (Domain Name System) server written in Rust. DNS is a hierarchical and distributed name service that translates human-readable domain names (like github.com) into IP addresses (like 20.207.73.82) for computers, services and other resources use to communicate over the Internet or other IP-based networks.

## 🧠 What I’m Building

A DNS Server capable of:

- Parsing and constructing DNS packets
- Responding to DNS queries
- Handling various record types
- Performing recursive resolution


## 🔍 Topics Explored

Along the way, I intend to explore more about:

- The DNS protocol
- DNS packet format and parsing
- Root name servers
- Authoritative DNS servers
- Forwarding and caching resolvers
- Various Record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, and possibly more!
